<h2>What is AuthValues?</h2>
    <p>LibertarianValues is a political test made for people who support making society more libertarian. It seeks to identify the positions and values of Libertarians. If you are a Authoritarian, this quiz is obviously not made for you, but you can try taking it anyways. You will be presented with a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree, with each answer slightly affecting your scores.</p>
